# DevOps Engineer

## Prompt

Write a Dockerfile to create a docker image for the simple app contained in the `app` folder. Once you've built the image, please answer the following prompts: 
1. Run the container and verify that the app works. Briefly describe the process and the output.
2. Is your solution ready to be used in a production environment? Why?

## Assessment Guidelines:
* Members of our engineering team will score submissions. They will be unaware of the authorâ€™s identity, resume, or background. They will have no access to information or documentation besides the submission.
* Scoring consists of 4 considerations of equal weight:
  * Runnability: was the assessor able to get the solution to run?
  * Functionality: does the solution solve the stated problem?
  * Readability: is the solution's code and documentation stylistically, idiomatically, and structurally sound? Does its structure, naming, and commenting make it easy to read?
  * Best Practice: does the solution follow best practices?
* Scoring Functionality and Testing depends on the runnability of the submission.
