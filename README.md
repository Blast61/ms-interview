Interview Questions

For each of the languages in this project, there are 6 questions, 3 hard and 3 easy. (candidates most comfortable with php and javascript - please excuse the visual studio solution and project files). Complete as many questions as you are able/would like, zip together the files containing completed questions, and email them to matt at mindmixer dot com.

Note - the more questions you complete the more we'll have as a basis of conversation. However, this is a system of diminishing marginal returns. 6 to 12 questions in 2 languages is probably a pretty good baseline.
