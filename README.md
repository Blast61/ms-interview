Interview Questions

For each of the languages in this project (js and python), there are 6 questions, 3 hard and 3 easy. 
There is also one html/css question comprised of a design to be implemented.
Complete as many questions as you are able/would like, 
zip together the files containing completed questions, 
and email them to matt at mindmixer dot com.

Note - the more questions you complete the more we'll have as a basis of conversation. 
However, this is a system of diminishing marginal returns. 
6 to 8 questions in 2 languages (or the html/css question) is probably a pretty good baseline.
