# Technical Decision
1. I chose to utilize React.js as my framework of choice because of its component based architecture. It is a well documented and widely supported framework containing a rich ecosystem of supporting documentation. 

I originally had opted to implement Remix.js as my frontend framework for its powerful SSR capabilities in an attempt to have a higher performant solution. I decided to pivot back to React.js due to a lack of framework maturity and a lack of a widely supported testing frameworks built for Remix.js; Compared to React that has many more widely supported testing frameworks. Another factor in my decision to pivot came when I realized that the abstractness that Remix.js causes can cause the source code to be slightly more difficult to digest, especially to developers that do not use Remix.js. I wanted to provide a solution that the dev team is deeply knowledgeable of and easily recognizes.
