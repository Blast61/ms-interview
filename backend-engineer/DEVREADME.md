## Summary
I have created a sort_list.py file that contains a class based solution ```SortList``` satisfing the prompt by taking in ```example-list.txt``` and outputting ```sorted-list.txt``` containing the original strings from ```example-list.txt``` sorted by number first then alphabetically. I also provided a full class testing suite in ```tests/test_sort_list.py``` leveraging Python's built in unittest framework. Lastly to ensure ease of running the program; I created an excutable bash script that when ran, run's the ```SortList``` program followed by the output of running the testing suite ```test_sort_list.py```.

## Steps to Run the Program
1. Open your terminal
2. Ensure you are in the ms-interview/backend-engineer directory.
3. Run the following command in your terminal: ```./run_sort_and_tests.sh```
4. You should expect the program to output a file ```sorted-list.txt``` containing the resulting sorted list from ```example-list.txt```, within the backend-engineer directory. You should also note the output from running the tests will be in your terminal. You should expect to see ```Ran 5 tests in...``` followed by ```OK```
